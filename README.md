# ALT://RXGC

A recreation of the 2023 Gamescom exclusive level `RXGC "Crucible"`.  
It's not 100% the same thing but pretty damn close.

### ~~RXGCHelper Plugin~~

~~Included plugin that removes the HSU Activator Machines on the dead-end tile to be accurate and prevent a softlock.~~

Isn't needed anymore because the custom tile used at gamescom has been added with the ALT://Rundown 6 update!
