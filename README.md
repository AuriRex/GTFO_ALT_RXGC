# ALT://RXGC

A recreation of the 2023 Gamescom exclusive level `RXGC "Crucible"`.  
It's not 100% accurate, things like lighting and enemy distribution might be off a little but overall it's really close.  
The level was designed to be beatable in under 15-20 minutes, as those are the time constraints before another team gets a shot at the game.

If you want the *real* Gamescom experience, make sure to wait 2 hours between attempts minimum because those queue times were something ... ðŸ˜‚

### ~~RXGCHelper Plugin~~

~~Included plugin that removes the HSU Activator Machines on the dead-end tile to be accurate and prevent a softlock.~~

Isn't needed anymore because the custom tile used at Gamescom has been added with the ALT://Rundown 6 update!
